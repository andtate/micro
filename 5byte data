Program 1.a: TO MOVE A BLOCK OF 5 BYTES OF DATA
FROM SOURCE 20H TO DESTINATION 40H IN INTERNAL
RAM.
ORG 0000H ; start program at 0000h location
MOV R0,# 20H ; initialize R0 with beginning address of source in
internal memory
MOV R1,# 40H ; initialize R1 with beginning address of destination in internal memory
MOV R5,# 05H ; r5 is initialized with 5 counts
check: MOV A, @R0 ; move the source data to accumulator
MOV @R1,A ; move the content of accumulator to destination
INC R0 ; incremet source address
INC R1 ; incremet destination address
DJNZ R5, check ; decrement R5 i.e., till count becomes zero
stop: SJMP stop ; stop incrementing Program Counter
END ; end of the program
