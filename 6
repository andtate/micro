Program 1.d: TO EXCHANGE THE SOURCE BLOCK STARTING WITH ADDRESS 20H IN INTERNAL RAM CONTAINING 5 BYTES OF DATA WITH DESTINATION BLOCK STARTING WITH ADDRESS 40H IN INTERNAL RAM.
ORG 0000H ; start the program at 0000h
MOV R0,# 20H ; initialize R0 with address of source locn.
MOV R1,# 40H ; initialize R1 with address of destination locn.
MOV R4,# 05H ; initialize count value into R4
loop: MOV A,@R0 ; move data from source locn. to Acc.
XCH A,@R1 ; exchange content of Acc. and destination
MOV@R0,A ; move destination data present in Acc. to source
INC R0 ; increment R0 to point next source locn.
INC R1 ; increment R1 to point next destination locn.
DJNZ R4, loop ; decrement R4 i.e., till count becomes zero
stop: SJMP stop ; stop incrementing Program Counter
END ; end of the progra
