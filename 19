Program 4.a: TO DEMONSTRATE DECIMAL UP COUNTER
FROM 00 TO 99.
ORG 0000H ; start program from 0000h
MOV A,# 00H ; initialize acc. with 00
MOV R1,# 64H ; load R1 with number of counts
loop: MOV 80H,A ; send COUNT to Port-0
ADD A,# 01H ; increment COUNT by 1
DA A ; convert to decimal
ACALL delay ; call the delay
DJNZ R1, loop ; decrement R1 i.e., till count becomes zero
stop: SJMP stop ; stop incrementing PC
; subroutine program to create some delay using instructions
delay: MOV R2,# 03H ; load count to R2
go: MOV R3,# 02H ; load count to R3
wait: DJNZ R3, wait ; decrement count until it becomes zero
DJNZ R2, go ; decrement count until it becomes zero
RET ; return to main program
END ; end the program
Result: The decimal count form 00 to 99 is observed on PORT 0.
