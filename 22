Program 4.g: PROGRAM TO SEPARATE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE NUMBERS IN A GIVEN ARRAY STORED FORM
3000H EXTERNAL RAM. STORE POSITIVE NUMBERS FROM
40H AND NEGATIVE NUMBERS FROM 48H INTERNAL
RAM.
ORG 0000H ; start the program at 0000h
MOV R2,# 05H ; load the count value in reg R2
MOV DPTR,# 3000H ; load DPTR with start address of array 3000h
MOV R0,# 40H ; load R0 with 40h where positive numbers are
stored
MOV R1,# 48H ; load R1 with 48h where negative number are
stored
loop: MOVX A, @DPTR ; copy the number into register Acc.
JB 0E7H, next ; check D7 bit of Acc. to find positive or negative
number, If negative jump to label next
MOV @R0, A ; else, store the positive number starting at 40h
INC R0 ; increment R0 to point next locn.
SJMP skip ; an unconditional jump to skip
next: MOV @R1, A ; store the negative number starting at 48h
INC R1 ; increment R1 to point next locn.
skip: INC DPTR ; increment DPTR to point next data
DJNZ R2, loop ; repeat until count (R2) becomes zero
stop: SJMP stop ; stop incrementing Program Counter
END ; end of the program
